        <p> Hi, I'm Yo. I've lived in New Jersey for most of my life, and love the passion and pioneering spirit that it has gifted me.
            When I was a child, I would be the one soothing another toddler or speaking softly to a crying friend.
            As I grew up, I continued to help others by doing the things that I loved like cooking, baking, or babysitting little kids.
            I have an innate drive to support others, and I love this about myself.<br> 
            My passion for coding developed in high school when I was introduced to Python and saw how much can be done with it.
            My biggest goal is to work with children and teenagers in abusive situations and help them get the mental health care that they deserve.
            I want to give people who are struggling the tools to be able to build a life for themselves.
            I intend to use my idealism, creativity, and attention-to-detail to create apps and websites that can be used in mental health recovery.
            I know the isolation and despair that mental illness brings, and I want to change that.
            No one deserves to feel the way I have, and I will do everything I can to prevent that.
            I've been in recovery for a year now, and am so grateful to have come this far. I want to see others come this far too! <br>
            I am currently enrolled in UCF's coding bootcamp, and hope to use this opportunity to learn more and develop my skills in order to accomplish my goals.
            Coding is the tool with which I will achieve what is most important to me, and I am so excited to learn! <br>
