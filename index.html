            <p> Hi! My name is Yo Wiesenfeld. I lived in Jersey most of my life and I recently moved to Florida and I
                love it! <br>
                My main goal in life is to help people get the mental health help that they need. I espcially want to
                help children and teenagers leave abusive situations <br>
                and help them create a life for themselves. I was a teacher for a few years and I now decided that I
                want to go into coding.<br>
            </p>
